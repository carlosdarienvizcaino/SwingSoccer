## Dev Notes on Project Structure
### Webpack
- Config defined in webpack.config.js. It defines the 'entry' as basic.js. It then will search through that files references, and the references of those referenced filed, etc until it captures all the required modules. It outputs one 'mega' file as lib/swingsoccer.js
### App.js
- This files starts the express server broadcasting on port 500 that hosts the game. It exposes one endpoint, '/', which returns a rendered version of lib/swingsoccer.jade. That swingsoccer.jade file has a body that contain the pixi.js dependency code as well as the 'mega' file, swingsoccer.js that was generated by webpack.
