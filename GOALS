Currently: I have achieved initial goal of being able to move sprite around
on screen with keyboard arrows.

Goal: Refactor code so that you can create a 'player' object that can have
injected to it a 'controller'/keyboard that handles input control..basic.js
should be small.

    Steps:
        - Investigate grant's code and understand the Immediately Invoked
            function thing for the player object
        - Create that for 'player' object
        - Be able to spawn 'player' in middle of screen with bunny sprite
        - create IIF for 'keyboard'
        - input keyboard into player
